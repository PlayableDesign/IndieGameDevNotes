# Game Design Documents

A traditional way to cover everything about your game is via the GDD. Lot of articles and templates exist on this topic, but an indie dev needs to move fast and often find you don't yet know everything to finish a full GDD. Here's some ways to capture game concepts incrementally:

* Use a [Trello](https://trello.com) board, with columns for each section of your GDD
* Use [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net) to create a mind map
* Use story boards to visually sketch out your game scenes
