# Art Tools

List of software for creating art assets with both paid and free options. In my experience, paid often means faster workflow and better industry experience but free options have matured and come close in features. Best to just pick your tools for vector and raster, then stick with them to master their features.

**Tip**: Use vector art to quickly prototype with shapes and then raster to add textures and details.

### Paid Software

* **Adobe Photoshop**: strong raster art features, some vector art features, strong industry recognition, PSD format popular, PSB format for use with Unity, expensive monthly/annual subscription
* **Adobe Illustrator**: strong vector art features, strong industry recognition, AI format popular, works with SVG and EPS formats easily, expensive monthly/annual subscription
* **Adobe Fresco**: good raster and vector art features, integrated with CC cloud, works well as a way to sketch, prototype ideas before bringing into Photoshop or Illustrator
* **Clip Studio**: good raster and vector art features, cross-platform including mobile, paid but reasonable prices
* **CorelDraw**: strong vector art features expensive one-time purchase or annual subscription.
* **Affinity Designer**: strong vector art features, time-saving features, reasonable pricing

### Free Software

* **Krita**: strong raster art features, efficient workflow designed for digital painting, supports PSD format, has some vector and animation features
* **Inkscape**: strong vector art features, efficient workflow, supports SVG and EPS, lacks shape builder tool and some other time-saving features in Adobe Illustrator
* **GIMP:** strong raster art features, some learning curve but can be very powerful on par with Photoshop with mastery
