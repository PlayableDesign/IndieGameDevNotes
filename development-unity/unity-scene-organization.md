# Unity Scene Organization

As you build larger and more complex scenes it becomes critical to organize your scene according to a standard. You can use empty game objects to act as dividers and containers in your scene for things like:

* Lights
* Cameras
* UI
* Actors (player, NPCs)
* World (ground, terrain, props, buildings)
* Dynamically spawned objects (effects, particles, bullets)

You can also setup a typical scene with these containers already in place and then set it as a template in your project (Unity 2020).
