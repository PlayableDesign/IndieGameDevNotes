# Camera Sizing

When I design a UI I build it at 16:9, and test it at 16:9, 5:4, 9:16, 4:5 and 1:1 just for giggles. This is obviously supporting both landscape and portrait. If you're only interested in landscape then only test at 16:9, 5:4 and 1:1. These are the ratios you're likely to encounter in the wild.

If you're only interested in landscape then only test at 16:9, 5:4 and 1:1.
