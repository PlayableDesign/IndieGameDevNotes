# Game Objects Stuck in Your Navmesh

You may sometimes have game objects, like NPCs spawn inside of structures or areas where they seem to be stuck. Often this is due to empty areas inside of a 3D model. Switch the editor to wireframe view and then bake your navmesh. If you spot small blue areas isolated, then you will need to fill them with placeholders or fix the models.
