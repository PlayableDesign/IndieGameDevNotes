# Finance - Funding

Resources for funding your development efforts.

## Budget

Start with a simple spreadsheet that covers what you need to spend money on:

* One-time purchases for things like hardware, perpetual software licenses, furniture
* Recurring costs for software subsriptions, memberships, dev accounts, hosting, email

Once you've collected everything you can think of, you've got your startup cost and burn rate for a year.

## Simple Pitch

Put together a basic pitch to share with anyone who asks about your studio.

* What type of projects will you be building? Cover games, assets, services, etc.
* What's going to be unique about you and your studio?
* What experience are you going to leverage to successfully complete projects?
* How will you monetize your projects and games?
* When do you expect to release your first project?
* Who else is involved, cofounders, team, partnerships, platforms?

## Personal Savings

I recommend you setup a legal entity and business bank account if you're going to be a serious indie game developer. You can often setup something like a single-member LLC or S-corporation yourself with an online service for cheap. Once you have that done, start off your bank account with a personal investment that covers all or a portion of the startup cost and 1 year burn rate.

* Simple business entity
* Business bank account
* Consult a bookkeeper to setup your accounting system or DIY
* Consult a lawyer or DIY business formation

## Cofounders

Use your simple pitch to inspire cofounders who will contribute money to the business. Make sure your business entity is structure properly to issue shares or equity. Unless you're a pro, don't do this yourself.

* Complex business entity
* Business bank account
* Consult a lawyer
* Consult an accountant

## Investors

Start with friends and family (at your own peril). Expect seed investors will want more equity for their risk. Add more to your simple pitch that mitigates potential risks.

* Improved Pitch
* Complex business entity
* Business bank account
* Consult a lawyer
* Consult an accountant

## CrowdFunding

Avoid the meddling of investors with crowdfunding. This doesn't mean you can ignore your contributors, you'll need to make sure you have a plan to interact with your community and keep them updated on progress. You can probably keep a simple business entity for this as well.
