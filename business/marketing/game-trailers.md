# Game Trailers

A good game trailer is critical to Kickstarters, publisher pitches, Steam stores and other marketplaces.

Some general guidelines:

* Length should be 60-90 seconds max
* Don't start with brand, logos, title screens - instead put at the end
* Hook the viewer immediately with game action
* Record key gameplay, avoid cutscenes and menus unless necessary
* Hide your HUD and UI unless it's necessary
* Match your music to the pace of the game
* Only include game sounds if needed
* Most common, simplest style is TITLE CARD > ACTION... repeat and end with "coming soon or available now on..."
* Title cards should be short, few words, few visuals as possible
