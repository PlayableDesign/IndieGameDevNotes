# Business Formation

_I'M NOT AN ACCOUNTANT OR LAWYER YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH PROFESSIONALS BEFORE DECIDING ON BUSINESS STRUCTURE_

## Why Form a Business?

If you're going to build and sell games, assets and/or services then form a business entity.

* Keep seperate personal and business finances and assets
* Legal protections
* Taxes
* Enable investment, funding options

## Keeping it Simple

An option for a solo indie dev is to choose a single-member LLC. This keeps your taxes simple but gives you that distinction between personal and business assets. In most states (USA) you can form an LLC online by yourself for low cost. After filing online and paying the fee(s) you will get formation documents that you can use as proof of your business entity. File for an EIN with the IRS, open a business bank account and then you're ready to start.

## When to Get Complex

If you plan to ask for investment, even just from friends and family, or to have partners/cofounders, then you will need a more complex business entity in order to issue equity in the business. Always consult with a lawyer and accountant for this.
